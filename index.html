                I am currently working as a consultant at Cybercom where I'm implementing a DevOps solution for Delaval. I graduated my Master of Science and Engineering at KTH at the Media Technology program 2019. My master was in Interactive Media Technology with Visual Media as track. My passion lies with immersive technology, computer graphics and rendering/simulations as well as front-end development. I am eager to get into new technologies and strive to learn as much as possible. My hobbies include going to the gym and telling terrible puns. I can play most songs on Expert difficulty on Guitar Hero.

                <div class="description">
                    In this project, swimming animations are created using UnityML
                    version 0.6 with their Reinforcement Learning training agents, using the policy PPO, created
                    by OpenAI. A humanoid character is placed in a simulated water environment and propels itself
                    forward by rotating its joints. The force created depends on the joints mass and the scale of the
                    rotation. The animation is then compared to a swimming animation created using movement
                    capture data. It is concluded that the movement capture data animation is significantly more
                    realistic than the one created in this project. The procedurally created animations displays many
                    of the typical issues with reinforcement learning such as jittering and non-smooth motions.

                    A psychological horror based VR game developed for The HTC Vive. The goal is to escape a haunted house by solving puzzles, all while the the horror increasingly ramps up to terrible levels. It was developed by myself and Bjarni, with the rest of the team members focusing on the economic aspect of producing a game. I did game design, effects, models, arch viz and optimization for the game. 
                    <br> This project was developed toghether with Bjarni Guðmundsson.

                    The first project in the course Advanced Graphics Interaction given at KTH. Our group developed an AR app with puzzle elements in mind. The goal is to redirect a light beam to a target. To do this, the user places mirrors in the real world that reflect the beam. My responsibilites included the game mechanics, i.e. how the light beam behaved and interacts, as well as effects, such as particle systems, virtual shadows on real world objects and blender models. On the website, you can find a downloadable demo as well as more information about my work with the project.

Mike is mute and thus must communicate by nodding and shaking his head to advance the story. My responsibilies included the game aspects such as VR with 270 degrees video, as well as solving interaction by head gestures.

                <div class="description">
                     A solo project for the course Computer Graphics and Interaction given at KTH. I decided to render a photorealistic version of the KTH courtyard in Unreal Engine. I worked in Maya to create all wall meshes with respective textures. I created sound system, day and night system and a snow particle system. The particle system also incrementally increases the amount of snow on the ground, starting by filling in the cracks on the stonework. More information on how I did this is in the blog listed below. The project is not on github, and until I get off my ass to add it, the only documentation is the blog used for by my examinator to grade my progress.

                <div class="description">In this project we evaluated different controller and steering possibilties in virtual reality. We evaluated whether controller-based steering or head movement-based steering was superiour in regards to efficiency and effectiveness. We found that using the head to steer was better in all regards, and caused less motion sickness than that of a controller. We tested the steering alternatives through a flight simulator. Please have a look at the cool video!

Through several iterations of our idea, and working accordingly to the double diamond scheme we ended up with our final product Spotify groups. The idea is to have a collaborative playlist, and share playlists and music styles with your friends. Please have a look at our cool video!
